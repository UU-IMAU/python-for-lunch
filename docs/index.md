# Python for Lunch!

For those of you who were around at the end of 2020, you'll remember that we used to have Python for Lunch talks. Well, they're coming back, and with a new lick of paint!

In these talks we'll go through some cool Python (and Python adjacent) tools, workflows, and technologies. **The emphasis is to cover topics that are the most beneficial to the scientists at IMAU**, so that you all can level up your workflows and pursue open science. There's no need to be an experienced programmer to follow along!

Down the line we may explore more advanced/technical talks if there is sufficient interest, but for the time-being it would be great to focus on the most impactful tools ðŸ’ª

As part of this refresh, we have this website!
