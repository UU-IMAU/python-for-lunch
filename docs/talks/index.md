## Prior

- [2025-02-25 | Git and GitHub: A time machine for every research project](https://github.com/UU-IMAU/python-for-lunch/issues/11)

    - [:octicons-video-16: Recording](https://youtu.be/QfojYVT01t0), [:material-presentation-play: Slideshow](./assets/20022025%20-%20Git%20and%20GitHub/index.html)
    - **Abstract:** Managing versions of a document is easy - just copy, paste, rename (often appending `_old` or `_draft1` to the end), and you're good to go. But what happens when your research involves dozens of inter-related scripts, datasets, and perhaps even collaborators? Suddenly the "copy paste" version management becomes a nightmare. How can we keep track of changes, prevent lost work, and confidently explore new ideas without fear of breaking everything? Enter Git, a version control system that acts like a time machine for your research. In this session, we’ll demystify Git, explaining its core concepts - commits, branches, and repositories - and show how it can be used by independent researchers as well as large teams. We’ll also introduce GitHub - a powerful platform for sharing, reviewing, and archiving research code. The talk is based off the highly polished "Version Control with Git" course from Software Carpentry.
