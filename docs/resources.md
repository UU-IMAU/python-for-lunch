# Resources

Here is a list of great resources for your enjoyment (not necessarily Python!). The resources are less technical - focusing on the technology from a scientist's point of view, rather than that of a computer scientist.

_The list is roughly sorted from most widely applicable at the top, to least widely applicable at the bottom._

<!--
When adding new entries to the lists, do so in the following format

```
- [Resource title](link)
    - ...
```
where `...` is the description (if needed).

If the resource is paid, put `ðŸ’°` at the beginning of the resource title. -->
