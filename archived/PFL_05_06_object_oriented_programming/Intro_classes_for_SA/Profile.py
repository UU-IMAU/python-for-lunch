#---------------------------------------------------------
# ncalls: for the number of calls.
# tottime: for the total time spent in the given function (and excluding time made in calls to sub-functions)
# percall: is the quotient of tottime divided by ncalls
# cumtime: is the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions (from invocation till exit). This figure is accurate even for recursive functions.
# percall: is the quotient of cumtime divided by primitive calls
# filename:lineno(function): provides the respective data of each function

# When there are two numbers in the first column (for example 3/1), it means that the function recursed.
# The second value is the number of primitive calls and the former is the total number of calls.
# Note that when the function does not recurse, these two values are the same, and only the single figure is printed.
