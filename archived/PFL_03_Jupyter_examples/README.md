# Seminar on: Jupyter notebook examples

Anneke's example demonstrates these concepts:

- plotting
- functions
- timing of individual cells
- Parcels

Leo's example demonstrates these concepts:

- load NetCDF using Xarray
- Matplotlib / Cartopy plotting
- loading external .py files using autoreload, so that any changes take effect immediately.

All of these concepts will be discussed in more detail later on.
