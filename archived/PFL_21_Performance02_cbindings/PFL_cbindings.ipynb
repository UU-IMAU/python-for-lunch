    "# Python for Lunch (PFL) - Performance Sessions - C-bindings \n",

    "# _A Python on Steroids_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we looked at memory consumption and speeding-up I/O-bound programs in Python. This week, we focus on the complementary case: speeding-up compute-bound programs in Python! (i.e. the actual **fun** stuff!) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In PFL 19, we looked at time measurements. At the closure, we measure *compute time*, *I/O time* and the *compute-to-I/O ratio*.\n",
    "We learned that the latter ratio indicates what we need to prioritize when increasing the performance of a program, and also said that compute-enhancing techniques (i.e. *Python-on-Steriods*) only makes sense if that ratio is *considerably higher than 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring those timings in actual, large Python programs is quite difficult due to the high conceptual level of Python.\n",
    "Realistic programs in Physics are often I/O-bound (i.e. ratio less than 1), cause data are stored in huge files and data copies are needed to hold previous-iteration values.\n",
    "Some codes (e.g. CESM or CMEMS themselves) are based on finite-difference *ordinary differential equations (ODE's)*, which require only limited external data input.\n",
    "Those codes are usually *compute-bound*, meaning that the performance bottleneck is the amount of *floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)* that are performed. It is also the case where using Python (as a programming language) can be _**the**_ major limitation.\n",
    "Today, we look into ways to speed up compute-bound programs in Python, continuing the theme of last week, where we looked at speeding-up I/O-bound programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Language Speed & Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all programming languages are the same. Every programming language has its preferred application scenarios, its intended use and its advantages.\n",
    "For some (or: most) of you, *Python* is the only programming language you know, whereas the *older generation* can still remember coding in *FORTRAN*.\n",
    "Those programming languages are very prominent in Physics. When comparing the two, one can overall observe that FORTRAN programs are very, very fast. The drawback of FORTRAN is that its very laborious to program, and very error-prone.\n",
    "Those are the drawbacks Python was uniquely designed to address and remedy - though the easy of development came at the expense of computation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point here: if we talk about *Python* as a language, we talk about *plain Python*, not: *NumPy*, *SciPy*, *Scikits*. Those difference we will discuss and experience within this PFL session.\n",
    "Actuual, plain Python consists of the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- for-loops (i.e. `for ... in range(start, stop)`)\n",
    "- while-loops\n",
    "- list-comprehensions (Python-exclusive)\n",
    "- for-each loops (i.e. `for obj in list`)\n",
    "- lambda-expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Computer Sciences (CS)*, the prevalent modern programming language that are most commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java (e.g. business-logic programs)\n",
    "- JavaScript (i.e. web-apps)\n",
    "- C++ (anything but web)\n",
    "- C (i.e. close-to-chip programming)\n",
    "- C#\n",
    "- Python (getting more promiment due to simplicity and AI/ML/DeepLearning-stuff)\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, all *high-level languages (HLL's)* - those are: all languages beyond *Assembler*, *C*, *C++/Objective C* and *FORTRAN* - are rooted in **C/C++**. \n",
    "That is because those 2 languages translate (via a *compiler*) directly into byte-code that can be executed by the hardware (i.e. the CPU).\n",
    "This translation step from an easy-to-use, type-less, error-resilient, interpreter-bound HLL into C-code instructions is a *speed malus* (i.e. performance cost) you 'pay' with each function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: using Python costs us speed in computation, and this cost can be measured in the runtime of programs.\n",
    "One intensely-discussed question in this context is: *How high is that cost ? How much slower is Python, compared to C or C++ ?*\n",
    "To quantify that, a good starting point are programming language benchmarks & speed comparisons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- overview: [the computer language benchmark game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/)\n",
    "- [Python3 vs. C (on Linux) benchmarks](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html)\n",
    " \n",
    "What we see in those comparisons is that Python3's speed (as runtime) compared to C is a between 2:1 (Python's runtime is 2x as much as 1 C-runtime) for toy-computations, \n",
    "40:1 for frequently occuring compute problems (e.g. sorting) and >100:1 for complex problems (e.g. nBody). Thus, if we want to get **real speed* of our *actual* calculations, we should not do them inside Python.\n",
    "The logical follow-up question(s):\n",
    " \n",
    "- **What shall we do ?**\n",
    "- **Is there the possibility to keep using _Python_, but then 'out-source' the calculations to C or C++ ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, those are the questions we urge to answer!"

    "## Case Study - k-Nearest Neighbour on Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, we design a suitable case study again. In the case study of today, we re-use the particle advection on flow-fields that we developed in PFL 19.\n",
    "In this case study, we tracer particles move on a defined flow field (i.e. *advection*) over a set time frame (or: number of iterations).\n",
    "Today, we expand the calculation by determining the *k-nearest neighbouring (kNN)* particles for *each particle* at *each iteration step*.\n",
    "This neighbourhood computation is well-known in CS as a very compute-intensive operation, as it involves and _N * (N over N)_ distance calculation, followed\n",
    "by a _k * N log N_ ordering of those distances. It is a typical computation bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, it's a good example because:\n",
    "- there is not just *1 solution* to the problem, and it can be solved in many ways\n",
    "- it's computational complexity is well-known and well-bound\n",
    "- thus, speed difference actually come from implementation differences\n",
    "- if follows the 'simple to code, hard to master' paradigm\n",
    "- it only consists of for-loops, branch conditionals etc., and thus can be done just using the inherent programming language instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start and prepare and run this example first using exclusively Python-code."

    "- the code inside the JIT function can only use *functions*, *data types* and *instructions* that are native in either (a) native Python or (b) NumPy\n",

    "We can conclude the following statements, when it comes to performance:\n",
    "- Coding compute-intensive functions in plain Python is *extremely inefficient* use of computational resources - it's very slow\n",
    "- Significant speed-ups can already be achieved with little effort by cleverly glueing one's physics-problem into matrix-like operations, using **NumPy** and **SciPy**\n",
    "- *SciPy*'s functions are nice, but \n",
    "  - (a) one needs to read up what those individual algorithms and functions do, to see if they apply to one's own scenarion\n",
    "  - (b) the functions, because they are tied to linear algebra matrix operations, can be very slow for large problem that don't fit into dense-matrix solvers\n",
    "- **Numba** is a very recent, very modern and quite easy way to transform one's original, simplistic Python-functions into super-fast C-functions with comparably little effort\n",
    "- you might as 'comparably to what': comparably to **ctypes**, which was the standard for JIT-compilation into C-code from the time before **Numba**; have a look into those helper-functions for the *ctypes* implementation to get an idea how difficult JIT-compilation was before ...\n",
    "- If you are building a long-lasting, large project that require a large amount of high-density computing and C-operations, then you need to familiarise with *pre-compiled C/C++ libraries* and the tools required to generate them\n",
    "  - **CMake**: the most widely-used, most user-friendly, but also most-compilcated-to-learn build system on the planet ...\n",
    "  - **Swig**: a versatile mark-up language to generate pre-compiled wrappers from C/C++ into languages such as Go, Python, Java, Perl and many more\n",
    "  - actual _**C**_ and **_C++_**\n",
