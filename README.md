# Python for Lunch

**All the information about Python for Lunch (i.e., prior and upcoming talks, contributing instructions, and extra resources) is visible on the [Python for Lunch website](https://uu-imau.github.io/python-for-lunch/).**

## Website dev notes

This website codebase uses `uv` and `mkdocs`. To get started (assuming you have the repo cloned already, and `uv` installed) do:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

to set up the environment and run the development server.
