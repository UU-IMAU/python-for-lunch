# Python for Lunch

**All the information about Python for Lunch (i.e., prior and upcoming talks, contributing instructions, and extra resources) is visible on the [Python for Lunch website](https://uu-imau.github.io/python-for-lunch/).**

## Building this website locally

This website codebase uses `uv` and `mkdocs`. To get started (assuming you have `uv` installed):

- clone this repo and `cd` into it
- run `uv run mkdocs serve` to set up the environment and run the development server

This project also uses `pre-commit` which you can optionally run locally (though not required as it's run in the cloud anyway).
